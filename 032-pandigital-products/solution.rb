# We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once;
# for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

# The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and
# product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

# Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a
# 1 through 9 pandigital.

# HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

# Defining an acceptable multiplier range for each number in (1..9999) optimized this problem very
# nicely, bringing the runtime down from over 20 seconds to under 700ms. Ignoring items within that
# range that contain repeating characters also helps marginally

# The clarification at the end of this problem is important, and I misunderstood it at first. If
# you're getting 56370 as your solution, you probably have the same problem. Take, for example, the
# combinations [18, 297] and [27, 198]. The products of these are the same: 5346, and both sets are
# pandigital. However, we require unique products in our solution, so we may only count this product
# once.
