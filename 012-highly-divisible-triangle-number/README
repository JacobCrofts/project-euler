The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

Solution: 76576500


The trick here, and I think this puzzle is unsolvable without it, is that if a number's prime factors are listed like this: a^r * b^s * ..., then the number of divisors for the number is (r + 1) * (s + 1) * ... . For example, the prime factors of 60 are 2, 2, 3, and 5. This may be written as 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1, and the number of divisors for 60 is (2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 12. Using this information, I was able to calculate the number of divisors for a given number very quickly.
