Hi! Welcome to my [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) puzzle repository. I'm new to programming, and I'm on a mission to solve all of the Project Euler puzzles with my first language, Ruby.

My priorities are the following, in this order:

1. write code that works
2. write code that's easy to read
3. write code that runs quickly

Some of the Project Euler puzzles may be solved with a single line of code. You'll find plenty of solutions around the web that do exactly this, that prioritize compactness over readability. My priorities are different; I want everyone, including those new to programming and those inexperienced with mathematics, to be able to read my code and understand my logic.

As always, I welcome feedback and advice (with these priorities in mind!)
