2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

solution: 232792560


Mathematical logic saves time here! Note that if a number is divisible by two integers, a and b, then the number must also be divisible by the product (a * b). The same applies to multiple integers (i.e. a, b, c, d, ...).

I know that 2520 is the smallest integer divisible by all in the range (1..10). So I can safely assume that my answer is divisible by 2520, and increment my counter accordingly.

Similarly, I only need to check to see if my number is divisible by the range (11..20) because the factors of the values in that range include numbers divisible by (1..10). For example, 12 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6, so if a number is divisible by 12, then it's also divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6.
